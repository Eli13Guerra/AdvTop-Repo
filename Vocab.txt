Set Notation: This notation expresses a coordinate (point) as the position within and across the sets of an element in curly brackets {}.
Mapping diagram: This visual representation connects the elements of the image set with the ones in the domain set.
Relations: These are the sets of order pairs.
Dimensionality Reduction: This is to reduce the number of variables to only those relevant to the model.
Discrete: A variable that can't have values between the available outputs.
Continuous: A variable that can take any value within the domain.
Deterministic Model: This model can be explained by assigning a rule to pair the domain and the image (function).
Function: A mathematical model correlating an independent variable with a dependent variable.
Well-behaved function: It is single-valued, continuous, and its derivative is defined and continues in all its domain.
Stochastic: It is a model whose outputs are dependent on a probability distribution and whose results can't be precisely determined.
Linear regression: It is a mathematical model in the form of y=mx+b that best fits a data set.
Non-linear regression: It is a mathematical model that has a different form than y=mx+b and best fits a data set
Data extraction for physical insight: It is to generate a model whose parameters represent physical properties and help to understand physical phenomena
Data extraction to create new data: It is when a model is generated to predict the behavior of a system and draw conclusions/predictions for future events.

Generalized function: Functional. The function of functions. 
Distribution Theory: Is to model behavior that classically would not be well-behaved with well-behaved functions
Sample: It is the subset that's being measured 
Population: It is the global set of all the possible outcomes.
Systematic sampling: Is to take samples from an observable in regular intervals
Deterministic system: When the system behaves by a function.
Statistics: It is the discipline that collects and analyzes data to draw conclusions and inferences about the data.
Random sampling: It is when the sampling frequency is not regular or doesn't follow any logical behavior.
Cluster sampling/stratified sampling: It is when the data is divided into different subsets (based on some criteria), and these are randomly selected for sampling.
