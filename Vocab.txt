Set Notation: This notation expresses a coordinate (point) as the position within and across the sets of an element in curly brackets {}.
Mapping diagram: This visual representation connects the elements of the image set with the ones in the domain set.
Relations: These are the sets of order pairs.
Dimensionality Reduction: This is to reduce the number of variables to only those relevant to the model.
Discrete: A variable that can't have values between the available outputs.
Continuous: A variable that can take any value within the domain.
Deterministic Model: This model can be explained by assigning a rule to pair the domain and the image (function).
Function: A mathematical model correlating an independent variable with a dependent variable.
Well-behaved function: It is single-valued, continuous, and its derivative is defined and continues in all its domain.
Stochastic: It is a model whose outputs are dependent on a probability distribution and whose results can't be precisely determined.
Linear regression: It is a mathematical model in the form of y=mx+b that best fits a data set.
Non-linear regression: It is a mathematical model that has a different form than y=mx+b and best fits a data set
Data extraction for physical insight: It is to generate a model whose parameters represent physical properties and help to understand physical phenomena
Data extraction to create new data: It is when a model is generated to predict the behavior of a system and draw conclusions/predictions for future events.

Generalized function: Functional. The function of functions. 
Distribution Theory: Is to model behavior that classically would not be well-behaved with well-behaved functions
Sample: It is the subset that's being measured 
Population: It is the global set of all the possible outcomes.
Systematic sampling: Is to take samples from an observable in regular intervals
Deterministic system: When the system behaves by a function.
Statistics: It is the discipline that collects and analyzes data to draw conclusions and inferences about the data.
Random sampling: It is when the sampling frequency is not regular or doesn't follow any logical behavior.
Cluster sampling/stratified sampling: It is when the data is divided into different subsets (based on some criteria), and these are randomly selected for sampling.

Random variable: Quantity or object that depends on random events.
Probability density function (PDF): It a function that models the relative probability of a random variable.
Univaraite: A function that depends on only a single variable. 
Probability distribution: Is a function that desribes the probability of the outcomes of a variable.
Discrete random variables: Random variables whose outcomes don't have continuity or midpoints between them.
Probability mass function: aka Discrete density function. Is a distribution of the probability of discrete values, therefore this is not continuos either.
Numeric Set: Set composed of discrete numeric values
Subset: A set composed of elements from an equal or larger set.
Mathematical Axioms: Is a statement than accepted to be true and correct. A set of ruler that define a mathematical space.
Cumulative distribution function (cdf): Is a function that adds from left to right the probability of the outcomes of the distribution (from o to 1)
Complementary cumulative distribution functions (ccdf): 1-cdf (from 1 to 0).
Measure theory: The probability of measuring all the events in a probability population is 1.
Mathematical spaces: Set of mathematical elements that obeys an structure mathematical axioms.
Bounds form an interval: Closed take the boundaries and open don't
Sthocastic convergence: The larger the set becomes or the longer it is studied, it will converge into a well define structure o behavior.
Scheffe's theorem: A function that's a sequence of integrable functions than converge will almost certainly converge. If all the elements converge and can be integrated, the sum of all of them is almost centain to converge.

Empirical distribution: Distribution of values taken directly from a physical observable.
Theoretical probability distribution function: It's a function that's use to model or understand data based on tunis parameters that can have or not physical meaning.
Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE): Is estimating the value of the parameters in a function given a set of empirical data.
Parameter Space: Is a space composed by all the possible values of a parameter in a mathematical model.
Conditional Probabilities: Are the probabilities of an outcome given than a previous event or outcome has already occured.
Residual: Is the difference between the observable and the model.
Error: The difference between the observable between a sample and the whole population.
Residual sum of squares: The sum of the squares of the residuals. 
Warsserstein distance: Distance function between two probability distributions.
Z-test or Students t-test: Statistical test to determine if two populations are different.
Central Limit Theorem: The mean of set of samples will follow a normal distribution.
Hypothesis test: Decision making test that allows to draw inferences or conclusion for the population parameters from statistical descriptors of samples.
Null hypothesis (Ho): The hypothesis that can be rejected or not (There's no diffences).
Alternative hypothesis (Ha): The hypothesis that isn't rejected (There are differences).
P-Value: Measures the probability of obtaining the observed results assuming the null hypothesis is true.
Parametric models: Model that captures the behavior of a system through a set of finite values.
Parametric statistics: Statistics that describes the probability of a population through the parameters obtained from samples.
Mixture models: Combinations of multiple models that interpret the behavior of a non-common distribution.
Non-parametric models: Statistical models that don't follow a normal distribution and are normally continuos.
Ranked Data: Data whose numerical value gets replaced by their rank (order).
Correlation Methods: Methods that depend on drawing connections and relationships between sets of data.

Open set: () Doesn't include the boundaries
Closed set: [] Includes the boundaries
Two-Dimensional coordinate system: Cartesian place (x,y).
Topological Space: Spaced defined by closeness and neighborhoods of data.
Distance: In a metric space is what defines the comparison rule between elements.
Connectedness: Is how a through how many neighbors are two elements connected of close to each other.
Compactness: How tightly close are the elements from the set to each other.
Continuity: When all the elements in a set have an image.
Cover: A group of sets that collectively contain X as a subset.
Surjective: All elements are mapped.
Non-surjective: Not all elements are mapped.
Injective function: Elements of A map only one element of B, and the elements in B are mapped only once.
